# Riley Bathurst Pattern Lab

Building this up in an atomic design way, theres a bunch to clean up in this theme so this will hopefully help me get it all sorted.

```bash
% npm run pl:serve
% npm run pl:build
```

## Sass

```bash
% sass source/css/style.scss source/css/style.css --watch
```

## To do

- Theres some problems with the main grids that need to be sorted in an easier way, this might just be doing a version somewhere that has nothing but color blocks in the grid
- Code family name as I'm using it other places
- can I make a single page for a color contrast?

### Style Guide

Until I get my own sorted better [https://cssguidelin.es](https://cssguidelin.es)

- 4 spaces
- Never use 3 margins or padding
- never leave empty html elements <!-- stay gold -->
- 1 blank line before a media query
- grid row before grid column
-
